	<p> Hi <%= firstName %>, </p>
	<br>
	<p>
		How have you been? It's been about <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> months since we last chatted so I thought I would just briefly catch you up. I've been learning to code full-time at Fullstack Academy (the on-site portion starts on Monday!). My hope is that I will become proficient enough at developing web applications to start my career in Silicon Valley by the end of this year. This is an auto-generated email I created programmatically for a project during the beginning of Fullstack Academy.

		I also created a new blog to talk about my experience. 
		My latest posts are:
    <ul>
      <% for(var i=0; i<latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
         <li><a href=<%= latestPosts[i].href %> <%= latestPosts[i].title %></a>  </li>
      <% } %>
    </ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Hope you're doing well, <br>
		Jimin
